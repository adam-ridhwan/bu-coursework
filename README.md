# CS300: Intro to Software Development

https://www.bu.edu/academics/met/courses/met-cs-300/
This course introduces basic concepts in discrete mathematics, computer systems and programming that are necessary for modern computing systems. It also develops analytic and logical thinking and prepares students to take graduate-level courses in software development degree. This course first reviews the basic concepts in discrete mathematics including logic, sets, functions, relations and combinatorics. Then it discusses the fundamental concepts in computer systems such as computer organization, basic OS concepts, CPU scheduling, memory management, process management and synchronization. Concurrently with the above mathematics and systems studies, programming concepts are introduced and practiced throughout the whole course using Python. 


# CS521: Information Structures with Python
https://www.bu.edu/academics/met/courses/met-cs-521/
This course covers the concepts of the object-oriented approach to software design and development using Python. It includes a detailed discussion of programming concepts starting with the fundamentals of data types, control structures methods, classes, arrays and strings, and proceeding to advanced topics such as inheritance and polymorphism, creating user interfaces, exceptions and streams. Upon completion of this course students will be able to apply software engineering principles to design and implement Python applications that can be used in with analytics and big data.


# CS622: Advanced Programming Techniques
https://www.bu.edu/academics/met/courses/met-cs-622/
Polymorphism, containers, libraries, method specifications, large-scale code management, use of exceptions, concurrent programming, functional programming, programming tests. Java will be used to illustrate these concepts. Students will implement a project or projects of their own choosing, in Java, since some concepts are expressible only in Java.


# CS701: Rich Internet Applications

https://www.bu.edu/academics/met/courses/met-cs-701/

The Rich Internet Application (RIA) Development course concentrates primarily on building rich client web applications in the browser for desktop and mobile devices. The course is divided into various modules covering in depth the following technologies: HTML5, AngularJS, and Ionic framework. Along with the fundamentals underlying these technologies, several applications will be showcased as case studies. Students work with these technologies starting with simple applications and then examining real world complex applications. At the end of this course, students would have mastered the latest and widely used RIA methodologies.
